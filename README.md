# Dictionaries

Dictionaries (a key/value mapping or sometimes also called a synonym table). Usually, dictionaries are used to clean or normalise values in dataset columns.

## Notes

- I wanted to keep the app without any extra external libraries(i just added uuid and node-sass), it could be done with a lot less code with redux-forms or just adding a library like lodash/ramda for more easy object manipulations
- Test coverage is ˜96%
- The context store is in sync with localstorage for persistence
- The dataset is totally dynamic(you can change the keys in the dataset.json and the changes in the table will be automatically picked up(no hardcoded values)).
- Bonus i added a dataset route in order to actually see the applied dictionary

## TODO

- show a warning next to the translations that generated a warning but they were added
- Add Helmet for dynamic title and description
- 100% test coverage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Launches the test runner with coverage

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
